surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool
of candlelight, watching.

The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from
Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon
spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor
McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape
loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar
expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And
Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.

"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian
Torture - I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I
know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....

Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs.
He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris,
his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry
couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as
he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled
for sure.

Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and
tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She
continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.

". . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,"
said Lockhart, "a series of attacks, the full story's in my
autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various
amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......

The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in
agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair
net.

At last Dumbledore straightened up.

"She's not dead, Argus," he said softly.

Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of
murders he had prevented.

"Not dead?" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.
"But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?"

"She has been Petrified," said Dumbledore ("Ah! I thought so!" said
Lockhart). "But how, I cannot say . . . ."

"Ask him!" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to
Harry.

"No second year could have done this," said Dumbledore firmly. "it
would take Dark Magic of the most advanced -"

"He did it, he did it!" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. "You saw
what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I'm a -
I'm a -" Filch's face worked horribly. "He knows I'm a Squib!" he
finished.
"I never touched Mrs. Norris!" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably
aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the
walls. "And I don't even know what a Squib is."

"Rubbish!" snarled Filch. "He saw my Kwikspell letter!"

"If I might speak, Headmaster," said Snape from the shadows, and
Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had
to say was going to do him any good.

"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the
wrong time," he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he
doubted it. "But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the
Halloween feast?"

Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the
deathday party. ". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were
there -"

"But why not join the feast afterward?" said Snape, his black eyes
glittering in the candlelight. "Why go up to that corridor?"

Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.

"Because - because -" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;
something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he
had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,
"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed," he said.

"Without any supper?" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across
his gaunt face. "I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people
at their parties."

"We weren't hungry," said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge
rumble.

Snape's nasty smile widened.

"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful," he
said. "It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges
until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should
be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be
honest."

"Really, Severus," said Professor McGonagall sharply, "I see no
reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the
head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has
done anything wrong."

Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light-
blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.

"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus," he said firmly.

Snape looked furious. So did Filch.

"My cat has been Petrified!" he shrieked, his eyes popping. "I want to
see some punishment!"

"We will be able to cure her, Argus," said Dumbledore patiently.
"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As
soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that
will revive Mrs. Norris."

"I'll make it," Lockhart butted in. "I must have done it a hundred times.
I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -"

"Excuse me," said Snape icily. "But I believe I am the Potions master
at this school."

There was a very awkward pause.

"You may go," Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When
they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into
an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry
squinted at his friends' darkened faces.

"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?"

"No," said Ron, without hesitation. "Hearing voices no one else can
hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world."

Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, "You do believe me, don't
you?"

"'Course I do," said Ron quickly. "But -you must admit it's weird ......

"I know it's weird," said Harry. "The whole thing's weird. What was
that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened...
What's that supposed to mean?"

"You know, it rings a sort of bell," said Ron slowly. "I think someone
told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've
been Bill . . . ."

"And what on earth's a Squib?" said Harry.

To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.

"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. "A Squib is
someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any
magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but
Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a
Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.
Like why he hates students so much." Ron gave a satisfied smile.
"He's bitter."

A clock chimed somewhere.

"Midnight," said Harry. "We'd better get to bed before Snape comes
along and tries to frame us for something else."
For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on
Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot
where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might
come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall
with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no
effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When
Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-
eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and
trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and
"looking happy."

Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate.
According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.

"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her
bracingly. "Honestly, we're much better off without her." Ginny's lip
trembled. "Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts," Ron
assured her. "They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of
here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's
expelled. I'm only joking -" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.

The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for
Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing
almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response
from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the
following Wednesday did they find out.

Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay
behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he
went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-
Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming
toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin
caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite
direction.

Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of
Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long
composition on "The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards."
"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short said Ron furiously, 
letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll.
"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's
tiny. "

"Where is she?" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling
his own homework.

"Somewhere over there," said Ron, pointing along the shelves. "Looking
for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before
Christmas."

Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.

"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot," said Ron,
scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. "All that junk
about Lockhart being so great -"

Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable
and at last seemed ready to talk to them.

"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out," she said,
sitting down next to Harry and Ron. "And there's a two-week waiting
list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk
with all the Lockhart books."

"Why do you want it?" said Harry.

"The same reason everyone else wants it," said Hermione, "to read
up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets."

"What'


Ja Jumala kutsui vahvuuden taivaaksi. Ja tuli ehtoo, ja tuli aamu,  toinen päivä.
Ja Jumala sanoi: "Kokoontukoot vedet, jotka ovat taivaan alla, yhteen  paikkaan, niin että kuiva tulee näkyviin". Ja tapahtui niin.
Ja Jumala kutsui kuivan maaksi, ja paikan, mihin vedet olivat  kokoontuneet, hän kutsui mereksi. Ja Jumala näki, että se oli hyvä.
Ja Jumala sanoi: "Kasvakoon maa vihantaa, ruohoja, jotka tekevät  siementä, ja hedelmäpuita, jotka lajiensa mukaan kantavat maan päällä  hedelmää, jossa niiden siemen on". Ja tapahtui niin:
maa tuotti vihantaa, ruohoja, jotka tekivät siementä lajiensa  mukaan, ja puita, jotka lajiensa mukaan kantoivat hedelmää, jossa niiden  siemen oli. Ja Jumala näki, että se oli hyvä.
Ja tuli ehtoo, ja tuli aamu, kolmas päivä.
Ja Jumala sanoi: "Tulkoot valot taivaanvahvuuteen erottamaan päivää  yöstä, ja olkoot ne merkkeinä osoittamassa aikoja, päiviä ja vuosia,
ja olkoot valoina taivaanvahvuudella paistamassa maan päälle".  Ja  tapahtui niin:
Jumala teki kaksi suurta valoa, suuremman valon hallitsemaan päivää  ja pienemmän valon hallitsemaan yötä, sekä tähdet.

Gemeinden des Grundbesitzes, ohne die persoenliche Freiheit anzugreifen. Dadurch 
ward das ackerbauende Proletariat schon so frueh maechtig, dass es wesentlich in 
die Schicksale der Gemeinde eingreifen konnte. Das staedtische Proletariat 
gewann erst in weit spaeterer Zeit politische Bedeutung.
In diesen Gegensaetzen bewegte sich die innere Geschichte Roms und 
vermutlich nicht minder die uns gaenzlich verlorene der uebrigen italischen 
Gemeinden. Die politische Bewegung innerhalb der vollberechtigten Buergerschaft, 
der Krieg der Ausgeschlossenen und der Ausschliessenden, die sozialen Konflikte 
der Besitzenden und der Besitzlosen, so mannigfaltig sie sich durchkreuzen und 
ineinanderschlingen und oft seltsame Allianzen herbeifuehren, sind dennoch 


Rizzi, quarantasei anni, si definiva "uno di quei liberali di cui s'è perso lo stampo", e soffriva per la sorte toccata alla sua città, occupata dai Tedeschi nel '43, da Tito nel '45 e dagli angloamericani poco dopo.
Le grandi potenze non volevano che i popoli della Venezia Giulia, d'Istria e di Dalmazia scegliessero liberamente il proprio destino, italiani tra gli italiani. Trieste era diventata un limbo, chiamato con sprezzo del ridicolo "Territorio libero". Né di qua né di là, né carne né pesce: la città e i territori a Nord assegnati al Governo militare alleato e denominati "zona A"; a Sud dei confini comunali, la "zona B", amministrata dalla Jugoslavia. L'umiliante imposizione era sancita dal cosiddetto "Trattato di pace" del '47. Ma la pace di chi?
Le strade di Trieste erano pattugliate dalla polizia civile del Gma, il cui nucleo mobile era soprannominato la "Quinta colonna di Tito" per la violenza con cui reprimeva le manifestazioni degli Italiani. Quanto alla zona B, Tito usava il pugno di ferro per cancellare ogni traccia d'identità italica.
Era tempo di riconquistare la dignità perduta. Forse proprio quel 5 novembre sarebbe stato il giorno della verità.
Insonne, incapace di interrompere le proprie rimuginazioni, aveva guardato l'alba dalla finestra della camera da letto.
L'8 ottobre s'era quasi riaccesa la speranza, con la promessa di restituire all'Italia la zona A. Ma il 3 novembre, trentesimosesto anniversario della liberazione di Trieste, il generale John Winterton aveva vietato qualunque dimostrazione patriottica e commemorativa. Nonostante il divieto, il sindaco Bartoli aveva issato il tricolore sul tetto del municipio. Winterton l'aveva fatto ammainare e sequestrare, rifiutandosi poi di restituirlo al Comune.
Il 4 novembre, anniversario della vittoria nella Grande guerra, Rizzi era andato alla manifestazione di Redipuglia, primo paese al di là della "frontiera". Al cimitero militare, una grande folla commemorava la liberazione dal giogo austriaco inneggiando a quella dal giogo slavo. Gli occhi di Rizzi si erano inumiditi nel vedere le delegazioni delle città irredente: Zara, Cherso, Lussino, Isola... Indimenticabile. La sera, tornati in treno a Trieste, uomini e donne non erano rincasati alla spicciolata, ma erano sfilati per le strade in piccoli cortei, poi confluiti in una grande manifestazione spontanea. In piazza dell'Unità ormai piú di mille persone si erano fermate tra il palazzo municipale e il Caffè degli specchi. Dal portone della Prefettura era uscito un ufficiale inglese della polizia civile, che aveva aggredito e malmenato l'alfiere del corteo, strappandogli di mano il tricolore. Proprio in quel momento era arrivato il nucleo mobile, impermeabili neri e moschetti, che aveva caricato i dimostranti. Questi ultimi, Rizzi incluso, si erano difesi sfasciando le seggiole e i tavolini del caffè, usandone le gambe come mazze. Durante il parapiglia, Rizzi era miracolosamente riuscito a recuperare il tricolore dell'alfiere, che ora recava con sé, ripiegato tra giacca e cappotto.
I tumulti erano proseguiti di fronte al monumento a Verdi in piazza San Giovanni, piazza Goldoni e viale XX Settembre, dove la folla aveva assaltato un cinematografo riservato agli ufficiali inglesi. In mezzo a tanta confusione, una camionetta della polizia s'era scontrata con un filobus: dieci poliziotti feriti.
In via delle Torri, dove si riasfaltava la strada, i dimostranti avevano tentato di ergere una barricata usando transenne e un rullo compressore. A una sassaiola gli agenti avevano risposto sparando in aria, poi dieci jeep avevano sfondato il blocco ed erano sopraggiunti furgoni carichi di agenti.

Mas ellos no obedecieron, antes endurecieron su cerviz, como la cerviz de sus padres, los cuales no creyeron en Jehová su Dios.
Y desecharon sus estatutos, y su pacto que él había concertado con sus padres, y sus testimonios que él había protestado contra ellos; y siguieron la vanidad, y se hicieron vanos, y fueron en pos de las gentes que estaban alrededor de ellos, de las cuales les había Jehová mandado que no hiciesen á la manera de ellas:
Y dejaron todos los mandamientos de Jehová su Dios, é hiciéronse vaciadizos dos becerros, y también bosques, y adoraron á todo el ejército del cielo, y sirvieron á Baal:
E hicieron pasar á sus hijos y á sus hijas por fuego; y diéronse á adivinaciones y agüeros, y entregáronse á hacer lo malo en ojos de Jehová, provocándole á ira.
Jehová por tanto se airó en gran manera contra Israel, y quitólos de delante de su rostro; que no quedó sino sólo la tribu de Judá.
Mas ni aun Judá guardó los mandamientos de Jehová su Dios; antes anduvieron en los estatutos de Israel, los cuales habían ellos hecho.
Y desechó Jehová toda la simiente de Israel, y afligiólos, y entrególos en manos de saqueadores, hasta echarlos de su presencia.
Porque cortó á Israel de la casa de David, y ellos se hicieron rey á Jeroboam hijo de Nabat; y Jeroboam rempujó á Israel de en pos de Jehová, é hízoles cometer gran pecado.
Y los hijos de Israel anduvieron en todos los pecados de Jeroboam que él hizo, sin apartarse de ellos;
Hasta tanto que Jehová quitó á Israel de delante de su rostro, como lo había él dicho por mano de todos los profetas sus siervos: é Israel fué trasportado de su tierra á Asiria, hasta hoy.
